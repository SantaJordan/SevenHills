<h2>Chef Alexander Alioto</h2>
<img id="chef" src="i/Alexander1.jpg">
<p>Alexander Alioto has studied around the world for many chefs, including his father, Nunzio Alioto, who has mentored him throughout his career. Alexander attended the Culinary institute of America in San Francisco where he graduated with honors. After graduating, he began his career at Valhalla Restaurant, under the guidance of his father who trained him in all aspects of the kitchen.From there, he began his staging throughout Europe and California.</p><p>
Working in Europe brought a new light to his career. In Europe, the undeniable passion chefs have for their talent rubbed off on Alexander quickly. He started his work in Sicily, where he worked on the coast in a quaint restaurant in the mountains. He learned two very different, but equally intriguing styles of cooking. The coastal cooking was solely fish, whereas the mountain restaurant dealt specifically with meat and mushrooms. While working on the coast, he experienced a day in the life where he would rise early to learn how Sicilians have been selecting and buying fish for generations.  While working in the mountains, he went hunting for mushrooms daily to prepare for the restaurant.</p><p>After Sicily, Alexander worked in the pasta capital of the world, Emilio Romagna.  He worked at San Domenico, a two star Michelin rated restaurant and one of the oldest in all of Italy.  Here, he learned about the magical world of pasta and deserts.  The chef at San Domenico was very old world but his techniques and passion for the business is something Alexander aspires to have.  The chef at San Domenico was very particular and knew exactly what was necessary to maintain his restaurant.</p><p> 
From Italy, Alexander returned to California where he furthered his staging at the French Laundry.  This stage taught Alexander not only incredible preparation of food, but organization and handling of the many important ingredients. This aspect of understanding product will allow him to bring the best product to your plate.  Alexander continued his culinary journey working for Ron Siegel at the Ritz Carlton, San Francisco, a one star Michelin restaurant.    After a few years of working for his family at Alioto’s Restaurant, Fisherman’s Wharf, Alexander and his partner Alexis Solomou are presenting you their first restaurant, Seven &#8226; Hills.</p>
