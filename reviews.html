<p><blockquote cite="http://www.zagat.com/lists/best-food-tops-san-francisco-bay-area-restaurants"><span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span>Creative farm-to-table cuisine inspired by Rome (a seven-hilled city like SF) includes amazing housemade giant raviolis at this darling, intimate Nob Hill trattoria that also offers an interesting selection of well-priced wines chosen by two master sommeliers; the caliber of cooking is comparable to more expensive places, plus a lively noise level and welcoming servers help create a friendly atmosphere.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>

We'll let SF Weekly food critic Jonathan Kauffman explain this take on the classic egg-filled raviolo: The pasta "is so translucent it barely tints the deep green of the spinach-ricotta filling ... In an age of sous-vide eggs and hydrocolloid-gelled juices, the raviolo uovo is a reminder that old-fashioned cooking of the most refined kind can produce miracles and surprises, too."<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>

[...] The Ravioli Uovo is to die for. I can say with confidence that it is the single best thing I've eaten all year. [...] Chef Alioto is a genius. The list of purveyors for Seven Hills is respectable, and I admire that commitment to responsible food. Lucky me, and lucky SF, for having Seven Hills.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote cite="http://www.opentable.com/seven-hills?rid=53791&restref=53791&intcmp=dcw"><span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span> After reading many positive reviews, we decided to check it out ourselves during a recent visit to San Francisco. We were not disappointed. The food is fantasic. Very reminisant of an unforgetable dining experience in Florence we had a few years back. You must try the Ravioli Uovo and Spaghetti with Grandpa George’s Sausage. The special of the day was the best of all - gnocchi with shrimp.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>
