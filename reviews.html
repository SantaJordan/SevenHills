We'll let SF Weekly food critic Jonathan Kauffman explain this take on the classic egg-filled raviolo: The pasta "is so translucent it barely tints the deep green of the spinach-ricotta filling ... In an age of sous-vide eggs and hydrocolloid-gelled juices, the raviolo uovo is a reminder that old-fashioned cooking of the most refined kind can produce miracles and surprises, too."<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>

A short cab ride from Union Square and a welcome and service which we have not had bettered for many years.</p><p> The menu is varied, and the pasta truly original, with a clear emphasis on quality and ingredients. Each dish was exceptional, and the flavours individual and stunning.</p><p> The whole team and the Owner are incredibly friendly. Talking to the Owner at the end of the meal, he was talking to us about the care that he goes to ensure he sources the best ingredients and it shows.....</p><p>  Finally, really, really good value - We had three courses and wine for $120, and that included the port!</p><p> Six Stars out of Five :-) <span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote cite="http://www.yelp.com/biz/seven-hills-san-francisco#hrid:2wqteTEvUeIewa6G3e9tug"><span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span></p><p>This is my new favorite restaurant.</p><p>I question what I have been doing with my life before Seven Hills.</p><p>I went for Friday date night, and everything was absolutely perfect.  The space is intimate and comfortable. The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable. Our waitress gave me an excellent recommendation to go for the Sangiovese Blend over the Pinot Noir following my Dolcetta, and she was absolutely right. And the food was incredible. The Ravioli Uovo is to die for. I can say with confidence that it is the single best thing I've eaten all year. Once you try it, you'll understand.</p><p>Chef Alioto is a genius. The list of purveyors for Seven Hills is respectable, and I admire that commitment to responsible food.</p><p>Lucky me, and lucky SF, for having Seven Hills.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote cite="http://www.opentable.com/seven-hills?rid=53791&restref=53791&intcmp=dcw"><span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span> After reading many positive reviews, we decided to check it out ourselves during a recent visit to San Francisco. We were not disappointed. The food is fantasic. Very reminisant of an unforgetable dining experience in Florence we had a few years back. You must try the Ravioli Uovo and Spaghetti with Grandpa George’s Sausage. The special of the day was the best of all - gnocchi with shrimp.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>

It also coronated them as the Bay Area’s top Italian restaurant, ahead of runners-up Acquerello, Delfina and La Ciccia.<span class="bqend">&#8221;</span></blockquote></p>
